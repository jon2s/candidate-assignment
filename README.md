# Layer0 Software Engineer, Solution Engineering Candidate Assignment 

### Inital thoughts
Wow.  Countless times, wow.  I am impressed with the tools that you have created.  Although the assignment was not terribly difficult, I did find that I spent a large amount of time exploring the docs and trying different things.  Many different rabbitholes were explored to say the least.  

### Intended results of the assignment
First and foremost I looked at this assignment as a means to dip my toe into Layer0 and get a feeling of the tools and take a deeper dive into how much faster Layer0 can make a website.

I also understand that this assignment is a means of Layer0 testing me to make sure that I am not just someone that can *talk the talk*, but I can also *walk the walk*.

### If I had more time

I look at this as what I assume that it really is.  Just a starting point into what all Layer0 can do.  As I mentioned above, I have already spent a good amount of time looking through the docs.  I've already had several different ideas pop into my head of how to leverage this with some of my personal projects.  For this project specifically, I think that taking a deeper dive into the rest of the site and how Layer0 could make all static pages or static portions of pages even faster.  I saw some amazing results and those results drive me to find more and more areas of improvement.

### Feedback

I do consider myself to be a node.js novice but I was able to complete this project with not much difficulty.  

I did find that inorder to get the Layer0 Devtools to display, I did need to run npm start atleast once.  Not sure this is this something with my setup or not.   

I think that the Devtools is incredible, but I found myself wanting to dig in deeper through the interface to find more detail.  

For example:

* What items were misses from the current page vs. prefetched items. 
* What items were misses and will continue to be misses as they are not set to ever cache.

Overall this was a fun and interesting learning experience.
